<p>This project is my gnarly system manager and dotfile auto-configuration tool since
<a href="http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/">dotfiles are meant to be forked!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/">Dotfiles</a> are funky hidden configuration files which
people use to customize their nerdery (and greatly enhance productivity): change how their prompt looks,
set up their $PATH, completely change everything about Vim,  adjust settings their settings
and do about a billion and a half other things. They're tons of fun, and I use them to get things
done <a href="http://mrandrewandrade.com/speed-of-thought/">at the speed of thought</a>.</p>

<p>This repo contains the files to get you started!   </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This setup was orignally taken from <a href="github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles">here</a>
and built on Linux Mint based on my own preferences.  The system should work for most
*nix-based (Unix-like) systems (such at Mac and Ubuntu).  If you are
using Mac, I highly suggest upgrading your terminal and using <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.    </p>

<p>To get started you either follow the command line installation instructions below
(by opening terminal and typing the commands) or you can
<a href="https://github.com/mrandrewandrade/dotfiles/zipball/master">download the files</a>
and unzip them in your home directory so that the path is <code>~/dotfiles/</code>.</p>

<p>You can then run makesymlinks.sh (by running <code>sudo bash makesymlinks.sh</code>) to install
everything.  Note, if you read the script, it creates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symlinks</a> from your home directory
to the files which are located in <code>~/dotfiles/</code>.  The setup script is smart enough to
back up your existing dotfiles into a <code>~/dotfiles_old/</code> directory if you already have
any dotfiles of the same name as the dotfile symlinks being created in your home directory.     </p>

<p>I also prefer <code>zsh</code> as my shell of choice.  As such, the setup script will also
clone the <code>oh-my-zsh</code> repository from my GitHub. It then checks to see if <code>zsh</code>
is installed.  If <code>zsh</code> is installed, and it is not already configured as the
default shell, the setup script will execute a <code>chsh -s $(which zsh)</code>.  This
changes the default shell to zsh, and takes effect as soon as a new zsh is
spawned or on next login.</p>

<p>So, to recap, the install script will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Back up any existing dotfiles in your home directory to <code>~/dotfiles_old/</code>
</li>
<li>Create symlinks to the dotfiles in <code>~/dotfiles/</code> in your home directory</li>
<li>Clone the <code>oh-my-zsh</code> repository from my GitHub (for use with <code>zsh</code>)</li>
<li>Check to see if <code>zsh</code> is installed, if it isn't, try to install it.</li>
<li>If zsh is installed, run a <code>chsh -s</code> to set it as the default shell.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can then configure any of your dotfiles by editing the files in 
<code>~/dotfiles</code>.</p>
